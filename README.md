# Physics Engine

A physics engine developed as an ongoing assignment for a course during my education at LTU.
The basic app framework was created by the programme coordinator Fredrik Lindahl.
All code inside the projects folder is of my own making as well as the contents of graphicscourse, physicscourse and mathlib inside engine/core.

The visual studio solution is generated using CMake.

The different projects each represent different stages of the implementation of the physics engine.
