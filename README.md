# Pyshics Engine

A physics engine developed as an ongoing assignment for a course during my education at LTU.
The basic app framework was created by the programme coordinator Fredrik Lindahl but all code inside the projects folder is of my own making.

The visual studio solution is generated using CMake

## Requirements

* CMake
* Compiler (tested on MSVC, GCC)
